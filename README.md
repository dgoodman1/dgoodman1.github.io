# Daniel A. Goodman's Personal Webspace
Welcome!  I'm a data/analytics professional with a passion for music, sci-fi, coding and understanding the world a little better.  I specialize in Python (with a focus on analytics) and relational databases, but I always enjoy learning new tools and skills.

Feel free to reach out to me at my username @gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-a-goodman/).
